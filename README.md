# regex_submatch

We create 2 automata m3, m4 to parse and extract submatches.

We make it accept only sound group match e.g. (a*) not (a)*

To write
-why 2 automata
-why m3 is reversed dfa
-why m4 is built that way
-how to make it compatible with circom
-example
-swap comment json.stringify 2 places to show readable M4

Note: Cant match , and \
